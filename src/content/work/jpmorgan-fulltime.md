Got an return offer for coming back to work at JP Morgan. This time I will be working in the AWM department. Just finished with the 2 weeks of hands-on training and excited to work on a lot of different things and learn in the process.

- In the training, learned about `Spring Boot`, `React`, `MyBatis`, `h2` + `SQL` database.
  - After the completion of the learning part, we were given some tasks to be performed in a team of 5.
  - Me and my team were able to complete **28/39** tasks and had the opportunity to present out work in front of the **judges(MDs)**

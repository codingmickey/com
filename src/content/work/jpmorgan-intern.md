Had an very amazing summer internship at JP Morgan Chase working in CIB department for Post Trade data. I got to work hands on with a lot of different things and learned a lot.

- Assisted in the migration of an application from `Angular4` to **Micro-frontend**(`Angular14`) along
  with **unit testing**.
- Refactoring old code and mainly resolving the unit tests to match the new interfaces and libraries.
- Helped deploy and scale the application using `Kubernetes` as well as automated a `Jenkins` pipeline for the same.
- Improved the serving of **static files** in the frontend via using `Ngnix` instead of bulky `Spring Boot`.
